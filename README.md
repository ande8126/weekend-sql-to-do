# To-doer

This is an ongoing project I started as a weekend-challenge assignment for Prime Digital Academy.
The current version allows my household to create and assign tasks, then mark them as complete or delete them.

## Browser-based to-do list, full CRUD

Assign and mark off household tasks with this to-do app, developed with front and back-end functionality. PUT and DELETE routes allow users to update the database on the status of a given task. Vanilla javascript on the client-side sends finished tasks to a separate table.
